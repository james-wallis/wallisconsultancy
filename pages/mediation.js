            Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially
            in which I as a trained neutral person, known as a mediator,
            assists parties in working towards a negotiated agreement
            of a dispute or difference.
          </p>
          <p>

            mediation in Berkhamsted and for mediation in Tring.

            or within management.

            Neighbourhood Mediation is helpful when neighbours or
            groups within a community are not able agree on an issue.
            Its use can stop matters getting out of control.
          </p>

            Family mediation can help you and your ex to work out an
            agreement about issues such as arrangements for children
            after you break up, child maintenance payments or a financial settlement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mediation can also be useful to help with other issues you
            might face, such as your children keeping in touch with
            their randparents, step families, or in-laws. It can also
            be useful for disputes within families and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any agreement reached through mediation, whether verbal
            or written is not legally binding but it is more likely
            to succeed as it has not been imposed on the parties.
