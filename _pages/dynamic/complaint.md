### Complaints

My objective is to provide you with a high quality service to help find a resolution to your situation.
However, if at any time you wish to make a complaint about any aspect of the mediation process then please let me know so that i can do my best to deal with it as quickly as possible.

An electronic acknowledgment of any complaint would be made within one business
day of receipt of such with a final response within four weeks of receiving the
complaint or a holding response explaining why I am not in a position to resolve
the complaint and indicating when I will make further contact which will be within
eight weeks of receipt of the complaint.
