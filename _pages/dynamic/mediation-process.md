Once I have confirmation that parties wish to proceed with mediation and provided me with an email address for each party then I will ask each party to sign and return an Agreement to Mediate. 

Once the Agreement to Mediate forms are received back then I will then have separate confidential conversations with each party to get the background to the situation, discuss the mediation process and the way forward. I take on cases of Mediation in Hemel Hempstead, Berkhamsted and Tring.

If all parties wish to have a joint mediation meeting then this will then be set up for a mutually convenient time and date using Zoom if considered appropriate but ideally face to face.

At the joint mediation meeting parties will be given uninterrupted time to explain their concerns and the affect of the situation on them and others troubled by the disagreement.  Discussion will then take place on finding a mutually agreeable way forward. Any actions would then be set out in a written agreement. 

Fees for this service can be seen in [Terms & Pricing](https://wallisfamilymediation.co.uk/terms).
