Once I have confirmation that parties wish to proceed with mediation and provided with an email address for each party then I will ask each party to sign and return to me an Agreement to Mediate form including full contact details which will be kept confidential. 

Once the Agreement to Mediate form is received back I will then have separate confidential conversations with each party to get the background to the situation, discuss the mediation process and the way forward. 

If all parties wish to have a joint mediation meeting then this will then be set up for a mutually convenient time and date using Zoom.

At the joint Zoom mediation meeting parties will be given uninterrupted time to explain their concerns and affect of the situation on them and others affected by the dispute. Discussion will then take place on finding a mutually agreeable way forward. Any actions would then be set out in a written agreement. 

Fees for this service can be seen in[ Section 5 of Terms and Conditions](https://wallisfamilymediation.co.uk/terms).
