title: About Mike

I am a retired senior banker with experience in both mediation and business support, personable and able to communicate easily at all levels.

Having worked within the family court judiciary for over twenty years I have gained a valuable insight into how the family court system operates. As such I am particularly highly regarded in family mediation but also in neighbourhood and workplace mediation. My experience in the family court has shown me that the court process should be used as a last resort and that mediation has an important role in helping parties move forward from conflict and breakdown to agreement and brighter futures.

Please let me know how I can help you. Contact me by sending an email with a brief description of your needs or give me a call. I will make contact with you within 24 hours.

I look forward to hearing from you and working with you.
