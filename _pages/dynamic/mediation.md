I am available for family mediation in Dacorum which can be face to face or online using Zoom.

Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially in which I assist the parties in working towards agreement of a dispute or difference.

Family mediation can help you to work out an agreement about issues such as arrangements for contact with children, child maintenance payments or a full Parenting Plan.

Mediation can also be useful to help with other areas of conflict. This could be about children keeping in touch with their grandparents, step families, or in-laws or disputes within families and friends. 

Any agreement reached through mediation, whether verbal or written is not legally binding but it is more likely to succeed as it has not been imposed on the parties.
