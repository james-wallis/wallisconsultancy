The service is available for workplace mediation, neighbourhood mediation and family mediation.

Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially in which I as a trained neutral person, known as a mediator, assists parties in working towards a negotiated agreement of a dispute or difference.

The service is accessible for mediation in Hemel Hempstead, mediation in Berkhamsted and for mediation in Tring. The service is therefore able to be used for these areas of mediation in the whole of the Borough of Dacorum, Hertfordshire.

Workplace Mediation can help settle conflict between staff and between staff and management or within management.

Neighbourhood Mediation is helpful when neighbours or groups within a community are not able agree on an issue. Its use can stop matters getting out of control.

Family mediation can help you and your ex to work out an agreement about issues such as arrangements for children after you break up, child maintenance payments or a financial settlement.

Mediation can also be useful to help with other issues you might face, such as your children keeping in touch with their randparents, step families, or in-laws. It can also be useful for disputes within families and friends.

Any agreement reached through mediation, whether verbal or written is not legally binding but it is more likely to succeed as it has not been imposed on the parties.
