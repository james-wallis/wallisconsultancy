If you live in Dacorum and are having a difficult family situation, do you want:

* A day in court,
* Continued disagreement,
* Depression as a result of tensions

***Or***

A mutually agreed solution with peace of mind and the potential for an improved relationship?

My experience, particularly as a family magistrate, is that mediation is by far the better way.
