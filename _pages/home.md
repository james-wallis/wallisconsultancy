If you are in dispute do you want:

*  A day in court,
*  Continued disagreement,
*  Depression as a result of tensions

***Or***

A mutually agreed solution with peace of mind and the potential for an improved relationship?

My experience, particularily as a family magistrate, is that mediation is by far the better way.

If you agree then let me try to mediate for you.
